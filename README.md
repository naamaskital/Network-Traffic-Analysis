# **Network Traffic Analysis and Application Classification**

## üìå **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing network traffic to identify application usage patterns, even when traffic is encrypted or anonymized.  
We extract key traffic features from PCAP files, visualize network behaviors, and build machine learning models to classify traffic flows by application type.

## üì• **Downloading the Required Files**
Before running the scripts, you need to download the following files:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Download Recordings**
The PCAPNG/PCAP recordings are available at the following link:  
- [Download PCAPNG Recordings Link(compressed)]
- https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=14X829KINkmqASNlD0QL5SC-1FJPSJMLY&export=download&authuser=0

After downloading,extract the ZIP, place the files directly inside the `recordings/` directory (not in a subfolder).
The directory structure should look like this:
```
src/                   
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_3/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ques_3.py      
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recordings/     
```

If the `recordings/` directory doesn't exist, create it.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Download the Prepared Dataset**
The dataset is available at the following link:  
- [Download Dataset (compressed)]
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vIyOnlJZkmR7iuWMG6v-1ei2M9xNkl-p/view?usp=drive_link

After downloading, extract the ZIP file into the following directory(name it combined_dataset):
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_4/         # Scripts for machine learning classification of network traffic
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ques_4.py       # Main script for training and evaluating ML models
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ combined_dataset.csv  # Preprocessed dataset for direct ML training
```
# üìä Traffic Classification Dataset Requirements

This project requires a dataset for training and evaluating a traffic classification model. Below are the dataset structure and formatting guidelines to ensure compatibility.

---

## üìÇ Dataset Format
- The dataset should be provided as a **CSV file** (`combined_dataset.csv`).
- The file should contain **one row per network packet** with the following required columns.

---

## üìë Required Columns
| Column Name       | Data Type  | Description |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| `Timestamp`       | `float64`   | UNIX timestamp of when the packet was captured. |
| `Size`           | `int`       | Packet size in bytes. |
| `Source IP`      | `string`    | Sender IP address (IPv4). |
| `Dest IP`        | `string`    | Receiver IP address (IPv4). |
| `Source Port`    | `int`       | Source port number. |
| `Dest Port`      | `int`       | Destination port number. |
| `Classification` | `int`       | Numerical category representing the application or protocol (e.g., `0` for Chrome, `1` for YouTube, `2` for Zoom). |

---

## üîß Features Generated in the Script
The script processes the dataset and generates additional features:

- **`Source IP Numeric`** ‚Üí Integer representation of `Source IP`.
- **`Dest IP Numeric`** ‚Üí Integer representation of `Dest IP`.
- **`Flow ID`** ‚Üí Combination of `Source IP Numeric`, `Dest IP Numeric`, `Source Port`, and `Dest Port`.
- **`Flow ID Hash`** ‚Üí A numeric hash of `Flow ID` (for feature stability).
- **`Inter-Arrival Time`** ‚Üí Time difference between consecutive packets in the same flow.

---

## üìã Example Row
| Timestamp   | Size | Source IP  | Dest IP    | Source Port | Dest Port | Classification |
|------------|------|------------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1678901234.5 | 1024 | 192.168.1.10 | 93.184.216.34 | 52345 | 443 | 1 |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Guidelines
- **Ensure all required columns exist** in the dataset.
- **Data types must be correct** (IP addresses as strings, ports as integers, timestamps as float/int).
- **Timestamps should be sorted** to properly calculate `Inter-Arrival Time`.
- **Each row should have a valid `Classification` number** corresponding to the application category.

---

## üöÄ How to Use the Dataset
1. Place your dataset file (`combined_dataset.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
3. The script will preprocess the dataset, extract relevant features, and train the classification model.

### üîë **Adding Keys for Traffic Decryption in Wireshark**

To analyze encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS), you will need to configure Wireshark to use the appropriate TLS keys:

1. Open **Wireshark** and navigate to `Edit` > `Preferences`.
2. In the **Protocols** section, find  **TLS**.
3. Add the **path to the private key** 
   - The keys can be found in the `recordings/` directory, where the capture files are stored. For example:
     ```
     /path/to/Network-Traffic-Analysis-main/src/question_3/recordings/sslkeys_all.log
     ```
4. Save the settings and restart Wireshark to decrypt the traffic.


### üîß **Additional Steps After Downloading:**
1. **PCAP Recordings**: Ensure that the files are placed directly inside the `recordings/` directory (not in any subfolders).
2. **Dataset**: Extract the ZIP file into the `src/question_4/` directory.
